                This was a side project I started a couple weeks after going full-time for the summer at Pipedream. The normal thing to do with your first paycheck is go to out and buy some really nice motors. I had been wanting to play around with the clearpath servos for a while and decided to design a pen plotter. I got hardware mostly together but ran into a few software hiccups, and ended up pausing the project when I went back to school. The original motion system was donated and helpfully cannibalized by my friends at the Imperial College Robotics Society and is now part of the "Thomas Godden Memorial Printer" in the lab. I've still got the motors laying around, so need to revisit this at some point.
