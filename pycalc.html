            Pycalc (sadly a non-unique name) is my effort to make a program that sits somewhere in the grey area between python, a calculator and a spreadsheet. It lets you write near-original python syntax while having real time outputs overlaid as you type. Additionally it has units and conversions implemented through <a href="https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">pint</a>. This lets you rapidly set up tweakable and reusable calculations using familiar syntax.

            App code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/LegoYoda112/py-calc">github.com/LegoYoda112/py-calc</a>, and while it hasn't been updated in a while, I still fairly regularly use this tool. If you end up using this for anything, shoot me an email. One day I'll spend a weekend to package this better into an application (/webapp) but need the motivation to do so.
