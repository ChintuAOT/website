            <p class = "dark">5x50 Drive is my own custom low cost BLDC driver. Paying $100+ per axis on hobby robots is way too much given that the actual harware involved can be fairly inexpensive if picked carefuly. In bulk (10+), the cost of this drive approaches $15, which is almost an order of magnitude cheaper than COTS alternatives. Both firmware and hardware development are ongoing, but has reached a good enough to be useful state where I have a current-based FOC loop and redumentary parameter get + set protocol / GUI implemented. See <a href="https://50x50-drive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">50x50-drive.readthedocs.io</a> for more hardware details and <a href="https://github.com/LegoYoda112/BLDC_Driver">github.com/LegoYoda112/BLDC_Driver</a> for firmware. </p>
