            <p class = "dark">One of my most favourite projects has been building out my own non-linear trajectory optimization tool. Given the amazing existing optimization libraries (namely CASADI and Ipopt) this is fairly straightforward to do. I initially experimented with single degree of freedom systems and have slowly moved my way up the non-linearity / underactuation food chain to flying machines (next up is walking robots!).

            <h3 class = "dark">// Behind the Scenes</h3>
            <p class = "dark">
                After posting a clip of this to twitter, I decided to do a quick writeup to explain what was going on and the tools I used to achieve it. This took the form of a medium article. I find it very rewarding to attempt to explain topics in simple language, because it helps demystify what's going on for those not familiar with, and forces me to check if I actually know what is going on myself.

                Some early tests of my trajectory optimization setup:

            <h3 class = "dark">// Next Steps</h3>
            <p class = "dark">
                While cool animations are great, they are a long way away from being able to command a maneuver like this out of a physical system. <br><br>

                Taking a trajectory and turning it into a set of linear feedback controllers is the next logical step, but requires a bit more framework to be implemented. I haven't yet figured out a nice, "elegant" way to generate and then implement a time varying LQR controller <br><br>

                The other option is to run online optimization, resulting in an MPC controller. This could either be used to stabilize a non-linear system, with or without a pre-planned trajectory. This also requires more work than the pre-planning approach, as online optimization needs refinement and testing to make sure it is safe to run live on a physical system.  <br><br>

                (the big next step is building something that can fly)
